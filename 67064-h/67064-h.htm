<p><span class="smcap">My dear Parishioners</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Cholera has visited Fulham the
second time.&nbsp; When it prevailed in 1832, it was always
understood that two deaths only in this parish were to be traced
to that fearful pestilence as their cause.&nbsp; But in the nine
weeks closing on the 8th instant, not only had the mortality
exceeded fourfold the average of the same period for the five
preceding years, but in this unusual number of 127 deaths, no
fewer than 56 were certified to the registrar, by the medical
practitioners who attended the cases, as having arisen from
cholera.&nbsp; In 35 instances, the previous illness did not
exceed twenty-four hours; and in 18 of them, it was less than
twelve hours.</p>
<p>There is another striking circumstance which attended our
recent visitation.&nbsp; Of the deaths <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>registered within this short and fatal
period, it is recorded that</p>

<p>Thus it appears that 58 of these deaths, a number not far
removed from one moiety of the whole, occurred within those ages
which are commonly considered the least susceptible of the
influences which shorten life.&nbsp; The year was passed below
which the highest range of infantine mortality prevails: for it
is well known that in England at large, one quarter of the
children born, and in some of the larger towns one half of them,
die <i>before</i> they attain their fifth year.&nbsp; Nor had the
period of life arrived when the growing infirmities, or the
confirmed chronic diseases of extreme old age bring so many to
the grave.&nbsp; Fifty-eight of our fellow-parishioners were
carried off in nine weeks, between five years old and fifty-five;
and in some of the most distressing instances, those
constitutions gave way the most rapidly which appeared the
healthiest and the hardiest of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>But there is one more remarkable fact to be noticed in
reviewing, as we are now mercifully permitted to do, the results
of this dispensation, that in all the <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>cases of cholera which ended fatally,
the sufferers, with three only exceptions, belonged to the class
of our poorest neighbours.&nbsp; They are recorded as either
labourers, or the wives, widows, or children of labourers.&nbsp;
They were, therefore, living in those parts of the parish where
the dwellings are the most easily to be procured, which fall
within reach of the means possessed by persons of this
description.&nbsp; And I grieve to say that they are for the most
part overcrowded with inmates, badly ventilated, badly drained,
and commanding a very scanty supply of good water, whether
adapted for drinking or for household purposes.</p>
<p>It is not my object in this letter to dwell upon the painful
reflections which are suggested by the fact of so many of our
immediate neighbours having been summoned thus rapidly into
eternity in the very midst of life; nor upon the profitable, and,
indeed, most awakening lessons, of spiritual and eternal import,
which their removal has left to be treasured up by us, who have
been spared in mercy to survive them.</p>
<p>Still less do I feel myself called upon to inquire how far the
facts to which I have above referred, in showing the mortality of
our own parish, are confirmed by the experience of others more or
less similarly circumstanced, whether in respect to their level,
their population, their sewerage, or their supply of water.</p>
<p>It would seem to be a main practical advantage to be gained
from the national judgment from which we <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>are now
recovering, if the inhabitants of each district, bound together
by many common ties and responsibilities, would apply their minds
diligently to consider by what preventable causes the calamitous
results of it have been aggravated in their own immediate
localities, and by what attainable measures it may be hoped to
avert or to mitigate the recurrence of them, before another such
dispensation shall arise.&nbsp; While the impressions are yet
vivid and authentic of the trial through which we have passed,
let us endeavour, as far as we can, in the faithful discharge of
our duty towards God and our neighbour, to turn to account, at
our own doors, the experience which it has left us.</p>
<p>The truth is, that I am the more anxious to submit to you the
proposal contained in the present letter, and to solicit your
intelligent and impartial examination of it, because it is
nothing more now than a sequel to those measures which were
brought under your notice at our meeting on the 17th instant, and
which you unanimously sanctioned.</p>
<p>It was agreed by us on that occasion to address a memorial to
the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, calling their attention
to the utterly defective state of the drainage of the parish, and
requesting them to effect an uniform and complete provision for
it in all the inhabited districts.&nbsp; This memorial has since
been forwarded to the Commissioners, with 160 signatures affixed
to it, representing a proportion of <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the property assessed to the parochial
rates equal to 15,000<i>l.</i> <a name="citation7a"></a><a
href="#footnote7a" class="citation">[7a]</a></p>
<p>Another resolution, for promoting the immediate erection of
public wells and pumps for the use of the poor, was also adopted
at the meeting in question.&nbsp; A subscription of above
250<i>l.</i>, since increased to 293<i>l.</i>, was raised to
defray the expenses of them; and there is every reason to
believe, that through the exertions of the Committee who have
undertaken to administer this fund, several of these wells will
forthwith be completed in different parts of the parish, in
situations most easily accessible to the larger populations of
the poor, and the least likely to be affected by the cesspools
and other collections of impurities, which in most instances make
their present pumps perfectly useless.&nbsp; They will thus enjoy
near their own doors a constant supply of that pure drinking
water, which, it is well known, may easily be obtained within a
few feet of the surface, in almost every locality of this
neighbourhood; and of which the want has been most confidently
declared, by the medical inspectors of the Board of Health, to
have been one of the chief aggravations of our late
unhealthiness. <a name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a></p>
<p>There were several persons, indeed, present on the 17th inst.,
who were prepared and even desirous to hear another proposition
brought forward, connected with the domiciliary condition of the
poor, and tending <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>to correct an evil in their present dwellings,
confessedly far more difficult to reach than either their
defective sewerage, or their scanty provision of water.&nbsp; And
it is one which not only affects most seriously their sanitary
state, but impairs all the decency of their daily habits of life,
and nearly defeats whatever means can be attempted for the
improvement of their spiritual and moral character.&nbsp; I
allude to the crowded manner in which they live together; the
landlord of the house too often entirely regardless of any rule
for restricting the number of its inmates; and his tenants
sometimes deriving a large profit, beyond the amount of their own
rent, from the numerous under-tenants whom they admit, without
scruple or restraint, to share in the occupation of them.&nbsp;
Thus it happens not unfrequently, that into a cottage with two
small bed-rooms, built and adapted only for a single family, two
or even three other families, besides individual lodgers, are
admitted.&nbsp; And from that hour must the inmates of it be
compelled to abandon all the happy arrangements of household
cleanliness, decency, and order.&nbsp; Mr. Rouse, in his faithful
and elaborate MS. Report on the sanitary condition of a large
part of this parish, states, that he has known in the summer
twenty-six persons living in such an house: and from fifteen to
twenty is the frequent number of their inmates.&nbsp; But while
it ought to be stated that the worst cases of this kind occur
among the Irish <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>labourers, they prevail to a greater or a less extent in
all the following districts, viz.: Parson&rsquo;s Green Lane,
Peterborough Row, Sand End, Garden Row, Carpenter&rsquo;s Row,
Dawe&rsquo;s Lane, Wheat-Sheaf Alley, Gain&rsquo;s Buildings,
Bedford Place, Stanley Place, the cottages near Normand House,
Orchard Place, Buckler&rsquo;s Alley, the Old Greyhound Cottages,
Marsh Croft, Sun Street, Star Lane, and Willow Place.</p>
<p>And it is a melancholy fact, that while in some other parts of
Fulham a considerable number of small houses have been built
within the last few years, of a more substantial and commodious
style, in order to meet the increasing wants of this portion of
the inhabitants, better drained, better ventilated, and in some
more healthy localities, they are gradually lapsing into the same
state.&nbsp; A very few of them once becoming occupied in this
comfortless manner lower the credit of those contiguous to
them.&nbsp; One tenant sets a bad example to the rest: and thus
in the very districts where some hope had been encouraged for a
time of better things, the same baneful system of crowding the
houses with lodgers is spreading.</p>
<p>The history of these masses of ill-regulated dwellings is,
alas! uniform and instructive.&nbsp; Some speculating builder or
other, oftentimes unknown in the neighbourhood, and having no
sympathy with the miseries which he inflicts upon it, becomes
possessed of a narrow slip of land, the mere frontage of a road
or <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>a
footpath, and erects upon it a collection of low, slightly built
cottages, with windows wholly unsuited to them, with no drainage
but that of cesspools, confined in their dimensions, rarely
emptied, and saturating with their noxious contents not only the
adjacent soil, but even the walls of the houses close to which
they are often placed; with no pumps for drinking-water but such
as soon become tainted by the contiguity of these very cesspools;
and with no provision of other water, but that which an
occasional cart, drawn by a miserable donkey, brings dear-bought
to the door.&nbsp; High rents, far beyond the means of the
tenants, but sternly collected as each week comes round, can only
be met by the vicious practice of subletting each room or
fraction of a room which can by any sacrifice be dispensed
with.&nbsp; Even the essential whitewashing of the walls within
is sometimes imposed as a burden upon the occupier, who of course
does it in the most careless way, instead of its being undertaken
by the landlord.&nbsp; And whenever the work of dilapidation
begins in one of these tenements, each successive tenant, flying
from his hard bargain, leaves it of course more dismantled than
he found it; until they become utterly unfit for the occupation
of human beings, whether under the summer sun, striking upon
their slight and exposed roofs, or the winter wind, penetrating
the settlements of their walls and the cracks of their
windows.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>This
account may, I believe, be taken as an accurate description of
the average character of these dwellings which are now provided,
without the option or alternative of any others, for the large
and rapidly increasing poor populations of the suburbs of
London.&nbsp; Such, I am confident, is the character of those at
Fulham.&nbsp; Let it be remembered that every improvement of the
worst built streets of London has a direct tendency to swell the
number of these inhabitants of its suburbs.&nbsp; And if it be
true that they enjoy, some from the very nature of their
occupations, and all from the position of their houses, a more
free ventilation during the day than is attainable by the pent-up
inhabitants of the narrow alleys and courts of the metropolis
itself, yet is there not one among them who can have access to
the improved dwellings, or to the baths and wash-houses, now in
successful operation for the health and comfort even of the
poorest classes, (though still upon a scale too limited to be
extensively useful,) in the parishes of Whitechapel, St. Pancras,
St. Martin, and Marylebone.&nbsp; Within the last ten days the
boon of these last-named valuable institutions has been promised
to the densely peopled district of Lambeth.</p>
<p>There is one fact connected with the late epidemic to which I
cannot forbear requesting your serious attention, and which, I
have little doubt, would be abundantly confirmed, if requisite,
by a reference to <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>the experience of other places.&nbsp; Whenever the
disorder affected the inmates of some of the less crowded and
better regulated houses, its progress was comparatively slow; the
symptoms were accessible to those medicines or palliatives, of
which the gracious Providence of God has taught us the value; and
by these means the last fatal issue was sometimes averted.&nbsp;
But whenever it assailed even the healthiest inmate of one of
those wretched abodes which I have described, the subtle poison
took its course at once; no remedies availed to reach it, and the
only symptom was Death.</p>
<p>Does not this fact speak volumes as to what we ought to do in
endeavouring to improve these dwellings of our poorer brethren,
before the Cholera comes again to visit us?</p>
<p>Of the extreme difficulty of the question, indeed, no one who
has ever considered it can deem lightly.&nbsp; Nor is it likely
that this difficulty will be effectually removed until the
country has the wisdom to bear, and the legislature the firmness
to enact some new statute that can reach it.&nbsp; Hitherto,
unhappily, our legislation, with the best purpose, has only
aggravated the evil which it sought to correct, and has thus been
moving in the wrong direction.&nbsp; The Building Act made it
penal for any person to lodge in a cellar, of which the height
came below a certain standard, or its window within a certain
width; and the only effect of this <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>prohibition has been to drive the
cellar lodgers into the attics, where they are stowed more
closely than before.&nbsp; The claims of reason, and morality,
and common decency have been urged in vain against this fearful
state of things.&nbsp; But since it has been proved, by the
history of such a season as that through which we have been
lately carried, to involve the actual considerations of life and
death, some power will surely, ere long, be called forth to
correct it.&nbsp; If the cupidity of the proprietors of a
steam-boat or an omnibus can be restrained, in order that the
capacity of those vehicles may be defined, and that we may travel
uncrowded in our journeys to and from the metropolis, has it not
become at length necessary that some attempt should be made to
regulate the stowage of a bed-room, and to rescue civilized and
immortal beings from the ruinous consequences of their present
mode of living?</p>
<p>If ever such a measure is passed, it will afford a better
scope than now exists for the operations of those useful schemes
with which we have become familiar under the title of the
&ldquo;<i>Labourers&rsquo; Friend Societies</i>,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;<i>Societies for Improving the Condition of the Labouring
Classes</i>,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;<i>Associations for Improving
the Dwellings of the Industrious Classes</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whenever any considerable number of the inmates of the present
houses of the poor are compelled to quit them, there will then be
a demand created, and at length, it may be hoped, a taste formed
for others more conducive to their health, <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and better
adapted to their social improvement than those to which they are
now doomed. <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile these Societies have solved one most important
problem, which cannot too forcibly be urged upon us.&nbsp; They
have shown, that without any appeals to the benevolence of the
public, healthy and comfortable dwellings can be provided for the
working classes of the community, upon reasonable rents, with a
remuneration of higher interest for the investment than can be
obtained in the Public Securities to those who may be induced to
embark their money in such undertakings.</p>
<p>My wish is to propose to you a plan for securing to the poor
of our own parish the benefits of one of these institutions, and
for gaining the sanction of our own Vestry to the first measure
required for the adoption of it.</p>
<p>It must be well known to many of those whom I am now
addressing, and ought to be known to all, that in the year 1837,
with the joint consent of the copyholders of the two parishes of
Fulham and Hammersmith, nine acres of the waste land known by the
name of Wormholt <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Scrubs, were taken by the Directors of the Great Western
Railway Company, at 150<i>l.</i> per acre, for the prosecution of
their works.&nbsp; The sum paid for this purchase was invested in
1487<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>, 3 per cent. consols, in the
names of G. Carr Glyn, Esq., Mr. John Knight, and Mr. George
Bird, the first of these gentlemen being selected to represent
the interest of the Directors, and the other two those of the
parishes which have a common interest in the land in
question.&nbsp; The stock still remains in the names of the same
individuals, and the dividends having been regularly invested as
they accrued, although in a different account, the whole amount
now exceeds 2,200<i>l.</i>&nbsp; There is a prevalent, and, I
believe, a well-grounded opinion, that under the terms of the
agreement made between the Copyholders and the Company, the
period has expired, within which the latter had the option of
giving land instead of money in exchange for the waste of which
they had thus become possessed; and that consequently the whole
amount of the stock thus described, the original investment, as
well as the accumulated dividends, will fall, under the
provisions of the Railway Act, in equal moieties, to the disposal
of the Vestries of the two parishes.</p>
<p>I am well aware that other schemes have been devised for the
appropriation of this fund, which, I apprehend, the Vestry will
in that case deem it their duty to devote to some object of
permanent <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>utility and benevolence.&nbsp; A disposition exists in
favour of alms-houses, either the erection of new ones, or the
better endowment of those already existing.&nbsp; But I may
surely remind you, that within the last year the intention has
been announced of a most munificent, though unknown benefactor,
to found twelve new and amply-endowed alms-houses at Fulham, and
thus to meet the additional demand, which, I admit, always exists
in such districts for these valuable institutions.&nbsp; And I
would submit to you, whether a wiser, or more seasonable mode can
be found for applying the fund in question, than to devote it to
the purchase of a piece of ground, centrally and conveniently
accessible to our poor, in the several occupations which they
follow, upon which either common dwelling-houses or separate
cottages may be built, with airy and well-ventilated rooms, with
moderate rents, to be collected weekly, and with an absolute
exclusion of lodgers beyond the members of the family to which
each house or apartment is separately let.</p>
<p>The land, thus purchased, might be conveyed to trustees named
by the Vestry, for the express purpose of building upon it such
dwellings as I have described, upon an uniform and
well-considered plan, and with an efficient agency to ensure an
adherence to it.&nbsp; And if a suitable site could thus be
attained for the object, there is reason to believe that persons
might offer the capital requisite for the building, from the
two-fold <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>motive of the dividend which they would realize, and of
the benefits which they would confer upon the poorer
parishioners.&nbsp; An improved sewerage, whenever it can be
effected upon a proper scale, would provide a better scheme of
drains than that to which they are now accustomed in their
ill-placed and inadequate cesspools.&nbsp; And since the
proprietors of the West-Middlesex Water-works have already
carried their supply into the northern and western extremities of
the parish, the further demand that would be created for their
water would induce them to bring it to the buildings in question;
and would not only enable the proprietors of them to lay on soft
water to every room at a very moderate expense, for the
convenience of the immediate occupiers, but also for a supply to
baths and wash-houses to be erected on a portion of the site, for
the equal use of other districts of the parish, if any sufficient
encouragement can be given to such a scheme.&nbsp; And such
establishments, it has now been ascertained, can also be
maintained upon the self-supporting principle, whenever an
adequate quantity of water can be gained for their consumption,
and a proper drainage for carrying it off.</p>
<p>It only remains for me to suggest, that if you should shrink
from the adoption of a scheme at once so extensive and so
responsible, from the obvious difficulty of creating an agency in
this parish adequate to <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the proper superintendence of it, we
might, having secured a site for the buildings, confide the
erection and management of them to the Association incorporated
by Royal Charter in 1845, and known as &ldquo;<i>The Metropolitan
Association for improving the Dwellings of the Industrious
Classes</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following sentence is quoted from
its prospectus; and any person who may wish to make himself
acquainted with its actual operations, has only to visit the
houses erected by the Directors in the old Pancras-road, leading
from King&rsquo;s-Cross to Camden Town, or those now in progress
near Spicer-street, Spitalfields.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The terms of the Charter do not restrict
the operations of the Association to the metropolis; and the
Directors have made arrangements for imparting the benefits,
privileges, and immunities, granted by the Charter under this
Association to Branch Societies, in districts wherein a
sufficient number of shareholders shall be desirous of erecting
improved dwellings for the industrious classes.&nbsp; The effect
of these arrangements will be to ensure (as far as possible) the
success of local undertakings, at the same time that those
benevolent individuals who may be disposed to subscribe for the
benefit of their respective neighbourhoods, will be made secure
against all individual claim and liability whatsoever.&nbsp;
Application has already been received from the parish of
Hampstead to be admitted as an Incorporated Branch <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Association,
and similar applications are expected from other
quarters.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am well aware, indeed, that objections are often raised to
any scheme, either of public benefit or of private accommodation
in this parish, which requires the command of ground, from the
alleged difficulty of obtaining it; and no one can be ignorant
how well founded these objections are, who has adverted to the
tenures under which large portions of the land situate within the
bounds of Fulham are held.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, we
cannot forget within what a comparatively recent period sites
have been purchased for different purposes, all requiring, like
that for which I am here pleading, open space, free ventilation,
and ready means of access.&nbsp; I need only enumerate the Roman
Catholic church, schools, burial-ground, and residence for the
priest; the new Union Workhouse; and the situation secured for
the Alms-houses already referred to.&nbsp; The successive
fulfilment of these schemes serves to show what may be effected
by influence and perseverance.&nbsp; Nor can I allow myself to
doubt, that, if it shall please God to excite among us a real
feeling of interest and anxiety adequate to the object, we may,
even before the present year has expired, see some plot of ground
placed at the disposal of the Vestry, combining all the
requisites which the project calls for.&nbsp; And surely, if we
may rejoice in the reflection that an improved <i>Workhouse</i>,
with all the watchful and <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>humane administration which, we may
hope, will characterise it, will provide for our orphan, or
deserted, or disabled poor, deserted in their infancy, or
disabled through the infirmities of old age; and that our various
<i>Alms-houses</i> will secure a comfortable maintenance to many
respectable individuals who have known better days, and have been
brought, without any fault of their own, to need the helping hand
of others; we may value it as an equal, if not a paramount duty,
to do at least what we can in improving the dwellings of some
families among our hard-working and intelligent, and still
independent poor; providing for their health, advancing their
comforts, and rescuing their children from the demoralizing
associations of their present homes.&nbsp; I cannot believe that
the difficulties, which confessedly surround the question, are
insuperable.&nbsp; Let us, at least, give our minds faithfully to
the consideration of them.</p>

class="smcap">Memorial</span> <i>of the undersigned</i> <span
class="smcap">Owners</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Occupiers</span> <i>of</i> <span
class="smcap">Land</span> <i>or</i> <span
class="smcap">Houses</span>, <i>situate within the Parish of
Fulham</i>, <i>and assessed to the Poor-rate in the amount
annexed to each of their Signatures</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>This Memorial sheweth,&mdash;</p>
<p>That the Sewerage of the parish of Fulham, containing by
admeasurement 1,648 acres, with a population, according to the
census of 1841, of 9,319 persons, but since very considerably
increased, with about 2,000 inhabited houses, and with a property
assessed at 40,000<i>l.</i>, is at this time in a most defective
state;</p>
<p>That some portions of the parish are liable to a Sewers rate,
without deriving any benefit from the application thereof;</p>
<p>That nearly the whole of the houses have no drainage whatever
beyond that of cesspools, which in many of the districts occupied
by the labouring classes, who are chiefly employed in the market
gardens, are badly constructed, placed in situations closely
contiguous to the dwellings, and wholly inadequate to provide for
the large accumulation of dirt constantly formed and decomposing
in such localities;</p>
<p>That during the prevalence of the recent epidemic, the
mortality for nine successive weeks, ending on the 8th instant,
exceeded fourfold the average mortality of the same season during
the five preceding years, nearly one-half of the deaths being
certified to the Registrar, by the <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>medical practitioners who attended
the cases, as having arisen from cholera, in many instances of
the most malignant character, and nearly all in those districts
where the drainage is most neglected, and among the poorest
classes of the inhabitants;</p>
<p>And that, without insisting upon the personal privations and
discomforts accruing at all times to the Parishioners at large,
and especially to the poor, who are the worst provided with means
to correct and palliate them, from such a state of things, the
parish will be exposed, upon any recurrence of so fearful a
visitation, to the same calamitous results, which the
Memorialists believe might mainly be averted by an uniform and
effectual Sewerage, extending throughout the inhabited portions
thereof.</p>
<p>The Memorialists, therefore, desire to represent to the
Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers their earnest desire that
they will, as soon as may be compatible with the other demands
upon them in the fulfilment of their arduous office, direct their
special inquiries and care to the parish of Fulham, and provide
it with a complete system of Sewers, adequate to the wants of its
large and continually increasing population.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
