<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>A
SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Revelations</span> xiv. 13.</p>
<p><i>And I heard a voice from heaven</i>, <i>saying unto me</i>,
<i>Write</i>, <i>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from
henceforth</i>: <i>Yea</i>, <i>saith the Spirit</i>, <i>that they
may rest from their labours</i>; <i>and their works do follow
them</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> solemnity with which the
doctrine contained in this passage is introduced, and the
remarkable way in which it is confirmed, declare loudly its value
and importance.</p>
<p>Amidst the visions of the Apocalypse, St. John had just beheld
an emblematical representation of the Church of Christ, and of
its Almighty Protector: a Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, with a
hundred and forty and four thousand, having his Father&rsquo;s
name written <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>in their foreheads: the faithful followers of their Lord
in a corrupt and degenerate age; the first fruits to God and the
Lamb; when his attention was directed to three angels, charged
severally with the high commissions of bearing the everlasting
gospel to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people: of
proclaiming the utter overthrow of the mystic Babylon; and of
denouncing the divine vengeance upon all her adherents.&nbsp; The
days thus prefigured were to be days of hardship and persecution:
the gospel, it is intimated, would not prevail without a
conflict, nor would Babylon fall from her pre-eminence, without a
hard struggle to maintain her ascendancy.&nbsp; <i>Here</i>,
therefore, as we read, <i>is the patience of the saints</i>; much
need will there be to them <i>that keep the commandments of
God</i>, <i>and the faith of Jesus</i>, to possess their souls in
patience, and to cultivate that meek and enduring spirit, which
shone forth in their crucified Redeemer.&nbsp; In order, then,
that under these trying dispensations, there may be no want of
encouragement to maintain constantly the faith of the gospel;
and, if necessary, to resist even unto blood, striving against
sin; the inspired Apostle immediately and abruptly proclaims,
<i>I heard a voice from heaven</i>,&mdash;a voice therefore of
truth infallible, and of authority not <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>to be controverted,&mdash;<i>Saying
unto me</i>.&nbsp; <i>Write</i>,&mdash;leave it as a lasting
record for the instruction of all future
generations:&mdash;<i>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord
from henceforth</i>: <i>from henceforth</i>, probably implying,
that from the period of this conflict between light and darkness,
the doctrine here announced should be more generally known and
understood:&mdash;<i>Yea</i>, <i>saith the Spirit</i>: the
declaration is sanctioned by <span class="smcap">Him</span>, who
is the Source of all inspiration; <i>yea</i>, they are blessed:
they are removed from this world of trial, <i>that they may rest
from their labours</i>, <i>and their works do follow
them</i>.</p>
<p>In attempting to explain this passage more at large, I shall
consider,</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The persons described, and,</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Their happiness.</p>
<p>It will remain for me, then, to offer some remarks, more
particularly belonging to the present afflicting occasion.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; We are to consider the persons described.</p>
<p>These are the <i>dead which die in the Lord</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>The
occurrence of similar expressions in other parts of the New
Testament, <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a> may serve to prove, that the person here
designated under the title of <i>Lord</i>, is the Lord Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; And wherever this phraseology is found, we have a
decisive testimony, in addition to that afforded by innumerable
other passages, to the transcendent dignity of our blessed
Redeemer.&nbsp; To substitute for the term <i>Lord</i>, the name
of any created being, of St. John for example, or St. Paul, would
be to render the clause altogether destitute of rational
meaning.&nbsp; It is intelligible only on the supposition, that
He who once suffered on the cross, and who, in the Isle of
Patmos, manifested himself in glory to his beloved disciple, is,
<i>God over all</i>, <i>blessed for evermore</i>.</p>
<p>Who then are the persons that <i>die</i> in the Lord?</p>
<p>The connexion of this passage with the description of those
turbulent times, to which the vision more immediately refers,
would perhaps justify the application of it, in the first
instance, to those who lose their lives in the cause of the
gospel: but the passage is doubtless to be interpreted in a
larger sense; and <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>must apply to multitudes in all ages, whether dying in
the usual course of Divine Providence, or driven from the earth
by the hand of persecution.&nbsp; That such is the view taken of
the matter by our Church, we are continually reminded, when the
intelligence is most seasonable and most impressive.&nbsp; While
we are standing around the grave to discharge the last tribute of
regard to those whom we loved in life, and whom we now seem to
have lost for ever, then it is that she proclaims to us by the
mouth of her minister, <i>Blessed are the dead</i>, <i>which die
in the Lord</i>.</p>
<p>We need, however, look little farther than the expression
itself, to be convinced that it must have a restricted and
peculiar application; and that it can by no means include the
whole body of those who are baptized into the christian faith, or
who continue to make a profession of Christianity.&nbsp; <i>He
that believeth</i> on the Son <i>hath everlasting life</i>: <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> when a blessing, therefore, is
pronounced upon them that die in the Lord, it must belong to
those who die <i>in the faith</i>:&mdash;that die in the cordial
belief of the great doctrines of revelation, and under the
influence of their practical and renovating power.&nbsp; Do you
ask, <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>What is
the nature of this faith?&nbsp; Our Church will return the
answer.&nbsp; <i>The right and true christian faith is not only
to believe that holy Scripture and all the</i> (<i>aforesaid</i>)
<i>Articles of our faith are true</i>: <i>but also to have a sure
trust and confidence in God&rsquo;s merciful promises</i>, <i>to
be raised from everlasting damnation by Christ</i>. <a
name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a>&nbsp; This faith, therefore, is not a
vague or unfounded dependence upon the mercy of God: it is a
<span class="GutSmall">TRUE</span> <i>trust and confidence</i>,
<i>and a</i> <span class="GutSmall">STEDFAST</span> <i>hope of
all good things to be received at God&rsquo;s hand</i>. <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a>&nbsp; <i>This is the true</i>,
<i>lively</i>, <i>and unfeigned christian faith</i>: <i>and is
not in the mouth and outward profession only</i>, <i>but it
liveth and stirreth inwardly in the heart</i>. <a
name="citation6c"></a><a href="#footnote6c"
class="citation">[6c]</a>&nbsp; Here then is the great point of
distinction between those who only <i>talk</i> about religion,
and those who are the subjects of its effective influence:
between those to whom the kingdom of God comes in <i>word</i>,
and those who receive it in <i>power</i>.</p>
<p>Wherever this sacred principle is found, it is accompanied by
the forgiveness of sins: by faith we are justified: the guilt of
our past transgressions is taken away, and we are accounted
righteous in the sight of God.&nbsp; Thus then we are admitted
into a new state, and <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>a new relation to the Father of
mercies.&nbsp; By believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, we are
brought from that state of alienation and hostility in which we
had previously lived, and through the merits of our Redeemer, are
reconciled to God, and become members of his spiritual
household.&nbsp; A person of this character belongs to the class
mentioned in the text: he has come to the Friend of sinners: he
is united to him as the branches are united to the vine, and
dying in this state, he dies <i>in the Lord</i>.</p>
<p>Now, as a subject of the practical and renewing influence of
faith, such a man will be reformed in his dispositions and
conduct: <i>if any man be in Christ</i>, there is a new creation,
<i>he is a new creature</i>: they, <i>that are in Christ
Jesus</i>, walk, <i>not after the flesh</i>, <i>but after the
spirit</i>.&nbsp; And this is a most important
consideration.&nbsp; The dispositions and conduct of such a man
cannot be derived from the corrupt nature with which he was born
into the world; but are, in some degree, conformable to the
spirit of Christ, and manifest the influence of that spirit upon
the heart.&nbsp; They are to be viewed, not as independent of a
lively faith, but as intimately connected with it, and
necessarily growing out of it.&nbsp; <i>It doth not lie dead in
the heart</i>, <i>but is lively and fruitful in </i><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span><i>bringing
forth good works</i>: <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a> and, although
distinct from the other graces and virtues of the christian
character, may be considered as the root of them all.&nbsp;
Faith, working by love, is the grand principle of the renewed
nature of man: and thus, living by faith in the Son of God, and
thus keeping his commandments, being justified from his sins by
the word of Christ, and sanctified from his corruptions by the
Holy Spirit, he is, if faithful to his calling, advancing in
knowledge, and love, and holiness, even to the end of his
days.</p>
<p>While, therefore, we do not deny that even at the eleventh
hour, a sinner may, for the first time, repent and be forgiven;
and that, <i>by faith given him of God</i>, <i>he may embrace the
promise of God&rsquo;s mercy</i>, <a name="citation8b"></a><a
href="#footnote8b" class="citation">[8b]</a> and <i>die in the
Lord</i>; for he possesses that principle which, if his days were
prolonged, would cause him to <i>walk</i>, <i>not after the
flesh</i>, <i>but after the spirit</i>: yet the most satisfactory
evidence that the person dies in the fear of God, and in the
faith of Christ, is to be gathered from the testimony of his
<i>life</i>: and if we want a stable confidence with respect to
his future state, the question is not so much how he <i>died</i>,
as how he had <i>lived</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>If these
views be correct, it is very possible for a man to die an
undisturbed and easy death, and yet not to <i>die in the
Lord</i>.</p>
<p>Imagine, for instance, the case of a confirmed infidel: why
should he be disturbed at the approaching termination of
life?&nbsp; The event was not unexpected: and, according to his
notions, there is nothing to apprehend beyond it.&nbsp; To betray
symptoms of alarm, is virtually to abandon his principles; and,
although he may tremble in his heart, the very <i>pride</i> of
infidelity will counsel him to bear up with apparent
resolution.</p>
<p>Tranquillity in death may arise from a variety of causes: from
constitutional apathy, from weariness of the world, from gross
ignorance of true religion, from a hard and unfeeling conscience:
and, therefore, taken simply by itself, without any good evidence
that it rests upon a right foundation, it can never be admitted
as a proof, that the man who possesses it, is duly prepared for
his change.</p>
<p>Neither can we repose with much confidence in this matter upon
theological knowledge and an orthodox creed.</p>
<p>Their value we mean not to disparage; but they cannot stand in
the place of true religion.&nbsp; <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>So decisive on this subject is the
great Apostle of the Gentiles, as to assure us, that although a
man <i>understood all mysteries and all knowledge</i>, and could
speak with the tongue of an angel, these distinctions alone would
profit him nothing.&nbsp; It is indeed to be feared, that all
knowledge on religious questions, which is purely speculative,
instead of humbling and improving the mind of him that possesses
it, tends rather to puff it up; and with whatever confidence we
may rest in a dying hour upon the correctness of our views, it is
possible for us to be as far from the kingdom of God and his
righteousness, as the most ignorant of our species.</p>
<p>Neither can we lay much stress in this argument upon vehement
and rapturous transports.</p>
<p>In many cases, they may be traced to the notions and habits of
the particular class of professing christians to which the
individuals concerned had previously attached themselves: and in
some other cases, they are connected with high-wrought feelings
or constitutional warmth of character, both totally independent
of the influence of religion.&nbsp; God forbid that we should be
supposed to throw discredit upon that holy and heavenly joy,
which has often cheered the heart of the christian in the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>last moments
of existence, as if he were already on the verge of heaven.&nbsp;
We are careful only to guard against the delusion, which is
satisfied with frames and feelings: these are not necessarily
derived from the communion of the Holy Ghost: and if it were
possible, under such an excitement, to give in the alleged cause
of the gospel our bodies to be burned, we might still perish for
ever.</p>
<p>In various instances, from the diseased state of some parts of
the bodily frame, so fearfully and wonderfully made, it becomes
physically impossible for the most devoted christian to bear his
testimony to the truth on the approach of death: the tongue,
which had perhaps announced to others the glad tidings of the
grace of God, may be silent: the eye may be dim: the intellect,
apparently failing with the flesh and the heart, may have sunk
into hopeless lethargy: and yet, with the evidence before us of
his christian life, we are persuaded that such a man dies <i>in
the Lord</i>.</p>
<p>We should not hesitate to come to the same conclusion in many
cases, where, while the senses are still comparatively perfect,
and the mind is still capable of expressing its feelings, there
is little manifestation of inward joy.&nbsp; It is doubtless
refreshing to stand by the bed of <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>a dying man, who can declare,
&ldquo;I am at peace with all men, and God is at peace with me:
and from this blessed assurance, I feel that inward joy, which
the world can neither give nor take from me:&rdquo; <a
name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a> but who shall presume to dictate to
the Spirit of God in what manner the faith of his servants shall
be tried, or how they shall be made ready for their change?&nbsp;
It is recorded of one of the most eminent divines of the last
century, that, as the time of his departure drew nigh, whenever
any questions were directly put to him concerning his prospects
of eternity, his answer usually was, &ldquo;I cannot say
much.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I rely,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;on
the promises for strength in time of need.&nbsp; There was a time
when I should have been very unhappy to have had so little of
sensible comfort; but I have seen reason to believe, that one of
the most acceptable exercises of true christian faith consists in
patiently waiting God&rsquo;s time, and in relying confidently on
the written word.&nbsp; For many years, I have been endeavouring
to live from day to day, as a pensioner on God&rsquo;s bounty: I
learn to trust him, and he sends the manna without fail.&rdquo;
<a name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a>&nbsp; And why should we not hope <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>favourably of
many others, who are tried even by strong doubts and fears
concerning their spiritual state?&nbsp; Is it not affirmed
concerning our compassionate Saviour, that a <i>bruised reed he
will not break</i>, and the <i>smoking flax he will not
quench</i>?&nbsp; Has he given the invitation of mercy to all
that are weary and heavy laden, and assured us, <i>him that
cometh unto me</i>, <i>I will in no wise cast out</i>?&nbsp;
Where there is a truly broken and contrite heart, these promises
will undoubtedly be fulfilled.&nbsp; Let us have the evidence of
poverty of spirit, of hungering and thirsting after
righteousness, of earnest and unremitted appeals to the Saviour
of sinners for that mercy which he offers to all that ask it; and
we will indulge the persuasion, that this contrite spirit shall
not be despised, that this humble penitent dies <i>in the
Lord</i>.</p>
<p>From these observations concerning the description of persons
mentioned in the text, I proceed,</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; To consider their happiness.</p>
<p>This is represented to consist in two particulars.</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; They rest from their labours.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; Their works do follow them.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>1.&nbsp; <i>They rest from their labours</i>.</p>
<p>The word <i>labours</i> may include all the harassing
occupations and afflictions of the world.&nbsp; Man, by the
condition of his birth, is <i>of few days and full of
trouble</i>: every rank in society, and every period of life,
have their several trials; and we shall not be released from them
till we find a shelter in the tomb.&nbsp; To all the ordinary
afflictions of mortality, the servants of Christ are as fully
exposed as the rest of mankind: and we know that they have
likewise troubles peculiar to themselves.&nbsp; For, look into
the New Testament; examine the representation there given of the
nature of the christian calling; consider the exhortations,
precepts, promises, so abundantly scattered through the sacred
pages, to stimulate and encourage us to fight the good fight of
faith: observe yet further in what manner the Apostles prosecuted
the work of their salvation; with what zeal, vigilance,
self-denial, perseverance, they encountered the hostility of the
world, the evil propensities of their own nature, and the
spiritual adversaries of their peace: with what energy they
pursued their race, with what armour they were girt for the
christian conflict; and then judge how arduous are the labours
which belong to that heavenly calling!&nbsp; We grant, that in
many <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>respects, those were days of singular hardship; but the
spiritual enemies, and the spiritual trials of the child of God,
are in all ages essentially the same; and with regard to the
world, according to the scriptural use of that term, while the
great springs of human action remain unchanged, and so long as
there is a visible distinction between the children of this world
and the children of light, the christian will always find himself
in a hostile land; and will prove, in his own person, that
through much tribulation he must enter into the kingdom of
God.&nbsp; For, observe any individual of exemplary piety; how
stands the world affected to him?&nbsp; Does it favour his
principles?&nbsp; Does it follow his example?&nbsp; Does it
rejoice in his light?&nbsp; Only let him be as heartily in
earnest on matters of religion, as sober reason must itself admit
that he ought to be: only let him <i>abound</i> in the work of
the Lord with a spiritual as well as with a temporal object in
view: only let him seriously and conscientiously endeavour to
walk worthy of his vocation, and sooner than he shall be exempt
from troubles, his foes shall start up, as it were, from his own
household; he will find enemies among those with whom he might
hope to take sweet counsel, and walk to the house of God as
friends.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>But it
is the happiness of them which die in the Lord, that they
<i>rest</i> from their labours.</p>
<p>There is an important sense, in which rest may be attained,
even during this present life; it is the promise of Christ to all
that take upon them his yoke and learn of him; and that promise
is fulfilled in our reconciliation with God, in peace of
conscience, and in that meekness, patience, and contentedness of
mind, which are among the fruits and evidences of Christ&rsquo;s
religion.</p>
<p>But the rest, of which the Spirit in this place assures us,
commences at the hour of death.&nbsp; And how beautiful is the
image!&nbsp; To the man wearied with labour, what prospect is so
pleasing as that of repose?&nbsp; What sound so sweet as the
promise of rest?&nbsp; Observe, then, the disciple of Jesus
Christ; tossed amidst the waves of this troublesome world:
harassed, not merely by the common afflictions of mortality, but
by troubles exclusively his own: conscious, moreover, that while
he remains on this stage of being, his vigilance never must be
relaxed, and his warfare never can cease: how welcome to him must
be the end of his probation!&nbsp; A deliverance from sin, and
care, and temptation, and pain!&nbsp; An escape into that
peaceful abode, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the
weary are at rest!</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Let it
not be inferred from these statements, that life and its labours
are regarded by the Christian as a grievance hard to be borne;
and that there is in his mind an impatient eagerness to be
released from them.&nbsp; Although, in this earthly tabernacle,
he may groan being burthened, and earnestly long to be dissolved,
yet are these feelings and desires kept within the bounds of
christian resignation.&nbsp; Convinced that all his trials are
permitted by infinite wisdom and infinite goodness, he learns to
be content with his state, to run with patience the race set
before him, and cheerfully to commit himself to the divine
disposal.&nbsp; Still, however, he cannot but be painfully
sensible of the perils and troubles of his earthly pilgrimage;
and we may imagine with what holy pleasure he will look back,
when landed in a better world, upon that dark and tempestuous
ocean which he so lately traversed!&nbsp; With what inexpressible
joy he will turn from the scene of his afflictions, to the rest
which remaineth for the people of God!&nbsp; Where is the
reasonable man among us who would not devoutly pray, according to
the language of our Church, that when he shall depart this life,
he may rest in Jesus?&nbsp; Happy to each of us will be the day
which shall release us from our earthly troubles, and call us to
a state unmixed <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>with pain, and undisturbed by apprehensions of evil!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>2.&nbsp; The second ground of happiness to them that die in
the Lord is this, that <i>their works do follow them</i>.</p>
<p>Faith, working by love, as we have already remarked, is the
characteristic distinction of the children of God; and it is here
expressly assumed, that they adorn their profession by the
performance of good works.</p>
<p>The phrase, <i>their works</i>, must be understood of that
entire course of conduct, which has its foundation in christian
principles; of well-doing, whether it respects the duty which we
owe to God, to our neighbour, or to ourselves; of obedience to
the commandments; of the exercise of all christian dispositions,
and especially of that love and of those works of mercy, which
our Saviour has so strikingly inculcated, both by his precept and
example.</p>
<p>These <i>works</i>, it is said, <i>do follow them</i>.&nbsp;
All that the world calls great, or pursues with avidity, we are
doomed, at the hour of death, to leave behind us.&nbsp; Our
wealth will not follow us; our dignities and honours will not
follow us.&nbsp; In this sense we brought nothing into the world,
and it is certain that we can carry nothing out; but if we die in
the Lord, <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>the works which we have done for his name&rsquo;s sake,
will go as witnesses on our behalf, to testify the grace of God
which was in us, and the manner in which we dedicated our talents
to his honour and praise.</p>
<p>The meaning of the expression is, that although we are
justified &ldquo;freely, by God&rsquo;s mercy, without our
deserts, through true and lively faith,&rdquo; <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a> yet shall we receive, at the last day,
a gracious recompense according to our works.&nbsp; To this
purport, many passages might be cited from the sacred writings;
and these, not merely of a general nature, but referring to
particular instances of piety, both in doing and suffering
according to the will of God.&nbsp; Do men, for example, revile
and persecute us, and say all manner of evil of us falsely for
Christ&rsquo;s sake?&nbsp; <i>Rejoice</i>, saith our Lord, <i>and
be exceeding glad</i>, <i>for great is your reward in
heaven</i>.&nbsp; Do we <i>sow plenteously</i>?&nbsp; We <i>shall
reap</i> also <i>plenteously</i>.&nbsp; Are we diligent in the
work and labour of love?&nbsp; <i>God is not unrighteous</i> to
forget it.&nbsp; Do we <i>turn many to righteousness</i>?&nbsp;
We shall <i>shine as the stars for ever and ever</i>.&nbsp; We
may state it as the fair inference from these, and a variety of
other considerations, that the more faithfully we <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>improve the
talents committed to our trust, by employing them to the end for
which they were given, the more patiently we endure tribulation,
and the more zealously and perseveringly we devote ourselves, in
the spirit of christian love, to the glory of God, and the good
of our fellow-creatures, the greater, in some mysterious sense,
shall be our reward at the resurrection of the just.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Among the individuals who have been raised up in these latter
days, for the benefit and consolation of mankind, few can be
mentioned who have either been engaged in works more important,
or who have brought to the task abilities more remarkable,
integrity more perfect, and devotedness more entire and
unremitted, than your lamented Minister.&nbsp; In speaking of him
to his own congregation, to those who, besides being acquainted
with his public labours, enjoyed the advantage of his personal
ministry, and beheld him amidst the charities of private life, I
may be supposed to address myself to a partial audience; but the
very circumstance of the following observations being delivered
in the place where <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>he was best known, and where his character could be most
fairly appreciated, will be some pledge, at least, for their
general truth and correctness.</p>
<p>My first recollections of your late Pastor carry me back to
the early period of my residence in the University of
Cambridge.&nbsp; At that time, I had no personal acquaintance
with him; but it was impossible even then to listen to his
sermons without being impressed with the persuasion that he was a
man of no common abilities, and of no ordinary character. <a
name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a>&nbsp; The history of many following
years in which he discharged the various and important duties of
a parochial Minister, warrants the assertion, that had he
continued in such a situation with competent leisure, he could
not have failed to stand in the first rank among his
brethren.&nbsp; So long as the opportunity was afforded him, his
parochial labours were indefatigable; and there are many
individuals still living who can bear witness to his success.</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>But he
was called to appear chiefly in a different character: and, by a
course of circumstances, which it is here unnecessary to detail,
his name has, for the last eighteen years, been associated with
some of the most extensive operations of christian
benevolence.&nbsp; In ceasing to be the minister of a parish, he
became more entirely the servant of the public.</p>
<p>When his ardent and charitable mind first interested itself in
the cause of the British and Foreign Bible Society, he little
anticipated, I believe, either the formidable nature of the
service which he undertook, or the continually growing demand
which it would urge upon his time and attention.&nbsp; Happily,
however, if it required extraordinary endowments, it found in him
a person suited to the task, and willing to spend and be spent in
the promotion of its christian object.&nbsp; I know of no
qualification demanded by that Institution of its Secretary,
which he did not remarkably possess; nor of any emergency that
befel it, in which he did not rise to the level of the occasion:
and when to this it is added, that the progress of the Society
afforded ample scope for his various powers, and that, perhaps,
in no other situation could they have been so fully called forth,
or employed so beneficially to mankind; <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>it seems
reasonable to conclude, that Providence smiled upon his
undertaking, and sanctioned the prosecution of it.</p>
<p>The conviction, indeed, that there exists a directing
providence, over-ruling for its own high purposes the pursuits
and occupations of men, when they, perhaps, little suspect it,
might lead us to observe, with some interest, the way in which he
had previously become qualified for this particular
appointment.&nbsp; It is of great importance to the welfare of
the Society, that its Secretary should be well acquainted with
modern languages.&nbsp; Your deceased Minister had not only a
singular facility in acquiring this knowledge, but it so
happened, that in his early travels, he had cultivated that
talent, and had made himself familiar with the manners, and
habits, and modes of thinking, which prevail in different parts
of the Continent.&nbsp; Little did he anticipate, when engaged in
these pursuits, to what account they would be turned!&nbsp; And
little would any one have imagined, while looking at the youthful
traveller, that he was thus training, however unconsciously, to
be the effective agent of a Society, which should, ere long,
arise to embrace, within the sphere of its benevolence, <i>every
nation</i>, <i>and kindred</i>, <i>and tongue</i>, <i>and
people</i>: and that in the very <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>countries which he now visited to
gratify a laudable curiosity, he should hereafter appear as its
accredited representative.</p>
<p>Those who may hereafter furnish us with a complete description
of his character and talents, will have much to tell, which, in
this brief sketch, I can scarcely notice.&nbsp; They will speak
of the fertility of his imagination; of the quickness of his
perception; of his lively and innocent wit; of the soundness of
his judgment; of his almost intuitive knowledge of character; of
his extemporaneous and commanding eloquence; of the facility with
which he could turn his mind to any subject proposed to him; of
his unwearied diligence and unconquerable resolution: and,
particularly, of that cheerfulness of disposition, and that
frankness, candour, and urbanity, which seemed to be interwoven
with his nature.&nbsp; But upon these and similar topics I have
no leisure to dwell.&nbsp; The great excellence in his character
to which I would most particularly advert, is the consecration
which he made of all his talents to the best and noblest
objects.</p>
<p>In early life he had shown no disinclination to lend himself
to pursuits unconnected with religion: and it is said, that, like
many of his young contemporaries, he took a strong interest <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>in political
questions.&nbsp; But from the period of which I now speak, and
for some years previous to it, he had ceased, in any sense of the
word, to be a party man.&nbsp; To the king he was a loyal
subject, and the radical and blasphemous spirit of the day he
beheld with feelings of serious concern: but on questions purely
political, I know not that I ever heard him deliver an opinion:
he was occupied by higher things: he determined to have nothing
else in view than the glory of God, and the benefit of
mankind.</p>
<p>For this object he lived; and it is not too much to say, that
for this object he died.&nbsp; Nor can we be surprised, that his
strength eventually proved unequal to the abundance of his
labours.</p>
<p>When I consider how deeply his mind was often affected by a
sense of the responsibility connected with his official
situation; when I reflect upon the many important discussions,
both private and official, in which the concerns of the Society
necessarily engaged him: when I look at his numerous journies, on
its behalf, into all parts of the kingdom; at the multitude of
crowded meetings in which he poured forth the treasures of his
powerful mind; and at the extensive <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>correspondence which he maintained
with the agents and friends of the Institution in every quarter
of the world; not to mention the valuable publications, which,
during that interval, he found leisure to compose, and his weekly
ministrations in this sacred place; it is to me matter of
surprise, not that he finally sunk under his exertions, but that,
for a period of eighteen years, he could bear up under those
incessant and overwhelming occupations.</p>
<p>In stating that he consecrated his talents to the glory of
God, and the benefit of his fellow-creatures, I tacitly assume
that he was influenced by christian motives.&nbsp; It is, indeed,
difficult to conceive by what other motives he could possibly be
influenced.&nbsp; By becoming a gratuitous Secretary to the
British and Foreign Bible Society, all worldly views he seems
deliberately to have renounced.&nbsp; Had he thought it right to
employ his great abilities with a view to secular interests,
there can be little doubt that he would have been eminently
successful: but he had a higher and a nobler aim; and the motives
by which he was guided were, as I am well persuaded,&mdash;and I
know that I speak the sentiments of those who were most
intimately conversant with him,&mdash;among the <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>best and
purest that can enter into a human bosom.&nbsp; The principle
which carried him on in his laborious career, through evil report
and good report, till his frame was worn out and exhausted, was
the divine principle of love to God and love to man.&nbsp; This
principle, and this alone, could have sustained him under his
manifold difficulties, and have kept him stedfast and immoveable
in the work.&nbsp; And did he ever express any concern that he
embarked in this cause?&nbsp; Was it a source of regret to him,
that he had left out of sight his worldly interests, and on
account of his devotedness to the Society had exposed himself to
discomforts and disquietudes, which assailed him even to the
last?&nbsp; Every person who was acquainted with him will bear
witness to the contrary; and a short record of his own, subjoined
to some notes concerning the progress of the Institution, and
written apparently within the last few months, will, by most
persons, be deemed conclusive as to the same fact.&nbsp; The
sentence runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How sweet to have toiled in this
work!&nbsp; And, if wasted with labours more abundant, he is
compelled to withdraw &mdash;.&nbsp; <i>I have
done</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last words occurring at a short distance from the other:
as if, after a pause for reflection, he had felt himself
convinced <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>that his strength was already worn out, and that in this
great cause he should labour no more.</p>
<p>The situation which he so long held in the Society required a
man of a large and liberal mind; and such he was in the best
sense of the word.&nbsp; His was not that spurious liberality
which looks upon all creeds with equal indifference, and regards
all as equally unimportant; his own views were clear and decided:
he was in heart, as well as by profession, cordially attached to
the doctrines and discipline of that Church, of which he had the
honour to be a Minister.&nbsp; But upon matters of inferior
moment he loved not to dwell: his delight was, without
compromising any of his principles, to contemplate the points
upon which Christians can agree, rather than to provoke debate on
those in which they may differ: and instead of indulging a spirit
of harshness, even towards those whose sentiments he totally
disapproved, his conduct was uniformly that of candour, and
kindness, and benignity.</p>
<p>I have hinted at certain painful circumstances, which, in
addition to the weight of his ordinary labours, very frequently
came upon him from some hostile quarters.&nbsp; This is not the
place in which I could persuade myself <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>to enlarge upon such a subject; and
were not the fact too notorious to be entirely overlooked, I
should have passed it over in silence.&nbsp; It is consoling,
however, to observe, that the hostility which your valued
Minister was called to sustain, arose entirely from his
attachment to the important work in which he was so assiduously
engaged, and from the diligence and success with which he pursued
it: and if he had a personal enemy, that enemy had most assuredly
a friend in him: in his mind no feeling of harshness could ever
remain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have witnessed with no little pleasure,&rdquo;
observes a common friend, &ldquo;his conduct and demeanour when
he was provoked into,&mdash;I should rather say, for it is
<i>that</i> I mean, when he bore, with unperturbed and
inexhaustible good humour, what would have provoked almost any
other man; and when he suffered to remain in the quiver arrows
which he could have sent forth with unerring aim and
vigour.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have, myself, seen him on many such
occasions, and a harsh or unbecoming word never, in my presence,
fell from his lips.&nbsp; The only feeling, I am persuaded, that
he ever entertained towards his most determined opponents, might
be expressed in the words of our Liturgy;&mdash;&ldquo;That it
may please thee to forgive <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>our enemies, persecutors, and
slanderers, and to turn their hearts: We beseech thee to hear us,
good Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pain arising from this unremitted hostility was doubtless
much alleviated by the kindness of his numerous friends.&nbsp;
There was, indeed, something in his character and deportment
peculiarly suited to gain the affections of all that approached
him; and seldom has any man, within the circle of his
acquaintance,&mdash;a circle, which included some of the most
distinguished individuals both in Church and State,&mdash;been
more highly esteemed, or more generally beloved.&nbsp; The regard
entertained for him on those parts of the Continent, which he
visited a few years ago, and from which he transmitted to this
country so much interesting and important religious intelligence,
is well known to many of my hearers: and there is reason to
believe, that the friends of the Bible Society abroad will feel
his removal, in common with ourselves, not merely as a public
loss, but as the loss of a friend and a brother. <a
name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>But the
great source of his consolation, and the crown of his rejoicing,
was the wonderful progress of his beloved Institution.&nbsp; Was
every successive year charged with new troubles and additional
anxieties?&nbsp; But the great work was also steadily
advancing.&nbsp; Were there many adversaries?&nbsp; But a great
door and effectual was opened; kindred Societies, both in the
Eastern and Western world, were not only rising in rapid
succession, but were effectually communicating their own spirit
to many subordinate Associations, within the sphere of their
respective influence: and testimonies were continually pouring
in, from all quarters, of the moral and religious effects
consequent upon this increased diffusion of the Holy
Scriptures.&nbsp; These things abundantly compensated him for all
his anxieties; and he dwelt with especial delight upon the
prospect now apparently opening before the face of all people, of
life and immortality brought to light by the gospel.</p>
<p>Does any person then demand where are the works that shall
follow him?&nbsp; The appropriate answer would be, Where are they
not?&nbsp; They are to be found in every region of the globe:
wherever the word of God has run, and been glorified through the
agency of this Institution, or of the Societies to which it has
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>given
birth: and into whatever lands the gospel of Christ shall, by
these means, be extended, there will be recognized the effect of
that mighty influence, to which, under the divine blessing, he so
largely contributed.</p>
<p>Let it not be supposed, that in connecting his name and
exertions so intimately with the progress of that great work,
which is now carrying on throughout the earth, I detract from the
honour which is due to other labourers in the same ample field;
they also will have their reward: and there are none who would
join more heartily in every sentiment which I have here ventured
to express, than those who have toiled with him in the same
service, and borne, in common with himself, the burden and heat
of the day.&nbsp; Were I merely to transcribe their own recorded
declarations, transmitted to me within the last few days, they
would confirm the strongest statements which have hitherto been
made of his important services.</p>
<p>We are often reminded, that, amidst the bustle and tumult of
public occupations, there is great danger lest personal religion
should be forgotten, and lest, even while endeavouring to promote
the salvation of others, we should be tempted to neglect our
own.</p>
<p>In admitting the propriety of this remark, I <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>cannot allow
that it is applicable in the instance before us.&nbsp; I might
refer to the unaffected humility of the deceased as often
manifested in his ready deference to others: &ldquo;I have seen
him yield,&rdquo; says a near observer, &ldquo;with the
simplicity of a child, to persons inferior to himself in
understanding and knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; I might advert to his
unshaken trust and confidence in God.&nbsp; When difficulties
were more than usually formidable, he was frequently heard to
repeat, &ldquo;If God be for us, who can be against
us?&rdquo;&nbsp; This was not, as repeated by him, merely a
well-sounding quotation; he acted upon the principle; he staked
upon it his ease, his prospects, his reputation, and his
life.&mdash;I might appeal to the impression of his friends
concerning the habitual seriousness of his character, and the
pleasure which he took in conversing with them upon sacred
things.&nbsp; Christian conversation was at all times delightful
to him; and by him was always conducted in a becoming
spirit.&nbsp; Whatever, indeed, might be his vivacity upon other
subjects, and however unrestrained within the limits of innocent
mirth the course of conversation, if any observations were
introduced of a religious tendency, he instantly checked his
imagination, and restrained the sallies of his wit.&nbsp; This
circumstance <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>is more particularly worthy of remark, because he
possessed, naturally, a cheerfulness and liveliness of
disposition, which, in his early days, might seem almost to
border on volatility: and, till disease had weakened his frame,
he continued through life to have such a flow of animal spirits,
that it must have required no ordinary check to keep them within
regular bounds.&nbsp; But on serious subjects he was always
serious.&nbsp; I speak, here, of the whole period within which I
was honoured by his acquaintance.&nbsp; Of late years, this
feature in his character appears to have been particularly
remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ever since his severe and tedious illness
in 1818,&rdquo; says a correspondent, &ldquo;I observed in the
whole of his conversation and deportment increased gravity and
seriousness.&nbsp; He seemed to have death and eternity most
deeply impressed upon his mind; and, on many public occasions, he
repeated with great emphasis those striking words; <i>Work while
it is day</i>; <i>the night cometh</i>, <i>when no man can
work</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be acknowledged, that even the most judicious friends
may form an incorrect estimate of the religious character and
christian virtues of those who stand high in their affectionate
regard.&nbsp; To see the interior of a person&rsquo;s mind, we
should follow him into <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>retirement; and by doing so, as far
as it is possible in this case, we shall, I think, discover much
evidence of a mind devoted to God.</p>
<p>Among the papers of our late valued friend, I find one which
he kept for some years suspended in his study, containing a few
verses of Scripture, calculated to give him courage and
confidence when in great hazard of being tempted to
unfaithfulness in his ministerial duty. <a
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a>&nbsp; In another paper are several
passages, from which, as it is stated in his own hand-writing, he
was &ldquo;accustomed to derive the greatest relief, support, and
direction.&rdquo; <a name="citation35b"></a><a
href="#footnote35b" class="citation">[35b]</a>&nbsp; <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>What an
instructive lesson would it have afforded to behold him, in his
many afflictions, thus casting himself upon the goodness of God,
and reposing in the comfort of his exceeding great and precious
promises!</p>
<p>On one occasion, when much depressed by very painful
intelligence, he writes; &ldquo;I sought comfort from meditation
on the word of God; particularly, I was much relieved by
reflecting on the passage; <i>In the multitude of sorrows that I
had in my heart</i>, <i>thy comforts refresh my soul</i>.&nbsp;
Oh, for faith in the divine promises, and the faculty of applying
them wisely and effectually to my own condition!&rdquo;&nbsp; At
another time, being greatly afflicted, and finding that a friend
was yet more troubled than himself; &ldquo;The comparison of
situations,&rdquo; he observes, &ldquo;threw me upon my knees,
and made me bless God for the kind proportion in which he had
measured out my chastisements.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Of a
somewhat similar description are the following
extracts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;April 23.&nbsp; Humbled myself before God
many times this day, having been astonished to find such powerful
corruptions within me.&nbsp; I betrayed a great hastiness of
spirit yesterday evening; this is a sign that the grace of God
has not been improved as it ought to have been.&nbsp; I will, by
God&rsquo;s assistance, watch against this propensity.&nbsp; And,
oh, that I may never again offend him, or wound my conscience by
falling into that snare of the devil!&nbsp; <i>Let every one of
you be slow to wrath</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday, April 24.&nbsp; Have humbled myself before God,
this morning; and do resolve to watch and pray that I enter not
into temptation.&nbsp; May the Lord pardon all my sins, and
secure me, by his grace, from falling into them again!&nbsp;
Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It ought to be recollected, that the writer was a man of
remarkably fine temper.</p>
<p>My next extracts respect his ministerial duties:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;August 9.&nbsp; Endeavoured to put Dr.
A.&rsquo;s advice into execution, to bear the people to whom I
was about to preach, fervently to the throne of grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;April 22.&nbsp; This day I performed a very <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>interesting
service in baptizing two adults, (young ladies) * * * * * I pray
God, that the beneficial memory of it may continue with me, and
with them, till the day of our death.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a somewhat later period, he again expresses the
affectionate interest which he took in their welfare, and the
hope which he entertained of their progress in true religion.</p>
<p>Most, if not all of these passages, were written many years
ago.&mdash;What, it may be asked, was the state of his mind as he
approached the termination of life?</p>
<p>Just before he was taken ill, his family read to him, by his
own desire, the Book of Job, with Scott&rsquo;s Observations; and
being placed at that time under certain outward circumstances of
discomfort, he was in the habit of applying what was read to his
own case.&nbsp; The progress of disease presently incapacitated
him, either for reading much himself, or of giving his attention
to others.&nbsp; But I learn, from different friends, who had
sometimes the opportunity of speaking to him, that his mind was
always most awake to subjects of religion; and that, whenever he
could be roused to mental exertion, these were the subjects which
recalled, for a time, his decaying energies.&nbsp; The
Sunday-week after his seizure, <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>when one of his daughters was sitting
with him, he laid his hand upon a book on the table, and asked
what it was.&nbsp; Being informed that it was the Life of Hooker,
he immediately began to repeat, in the words of that excellent
man; &ldquo;I have lived to see this world is made up of
perturbations; and I have long been preparing to leave it; and
gathering comfort for the dreadful hour of making my account with
God,&mdash;and though I have, by his grace, loved him in my
youth, and feared him in mine age; and laboured to have a
conscience void of offence to Him and to all men; yet, if thou, O
Lord, be extreme to mark what I have done amiss, who can abide
it?&nbsp; And therefore, where I have failed, Lord, shew mercy to
me; for I plead not my righteousness, but the forgiveness of my
unrighteousness, for his merits who died to purchase a pardon for
penitent sinners!&nbsp; And, since I owe thee a death, Lord, let
it not be terrible, and then take thine own time; I submit to it:
let not mine, O Lord, but thy will, be done!&rdquo;&nbsp; This
passage, it seems, he was much in the habit of repeating,
doubtless from its expressing the views and feelings which he
habitually entertained.&nbsp; In one of his last letters to the
same daughter, he writes in these terms; <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>&ldquo;My
frame has been so shattered, that I must not expect it to be
<i>speedily</i>, perhaps, never thoroughly repaired.&nbsp; There
is nothing I wish to live for, but the service of my Divine
Master; and if I may but be favoured with the testimony of having
pleased him, and possessing an interest in his love, I shall be
willing to live or to die, as to him may appear best.&nbsp; Oh,
my dear daughter, this should be our first, our last, our
invariable object; we cannot dispense with its consolations in
sickness, or its support in death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only remaining paper to which I shall refer, was written
when he was deprived by sickness of the privilege of public
worship. <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What a mercy it is,&rdquo; he observes,
&ldquo;that, as well from the nature of God, as from his
condescension, and the tenor of his promises, we can have access
to him in privacy and solitude, when precluded, by sickness or
other impediments, from worshipping him in public, and with the
congregation of his saints.&nbsp; Of this mercy, I, who during
many months have been confined to my bed, my chamber, or my
house, desire to be deeply sensible, and to make it the subject
<a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>of my most
devout and grateful thanksgiving:&mdash;<i>Pray to thy Father
which is in
secret</i>:&mdash;<i>ask</i>,&mdash;<i>seek</i>,&mdash;<i>knock</i>,&mdash;<i>draw
nigh unto God</i>; and every other direction of a similar
tendency are of unlimited application; and the promises annexed
to them may be depended on, as engaged to be made good as often
as the direction is spiritually complied with, and faithfully
performed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Private</i> worship, which consists in acts and
offerings of prayer and praise, is the peculiar and spiritual
duty of the invalid; and the privileges annexed to it are
peculiarly his property.&nbsp; In this worship he ought to
abound; he cannot perform it too frequently, and in proportion as
he abounds and perseveres in the performance of it, may he expect
the promised blessing.&nbsp; He may confess his sins, and
supplicate the mercy of God in Christ, as frequently as he feels
the guilt of the former, and his need of the latter;&mdash;he
cannot confess or supplicate too often, he cannot ask too much,
or with too great importunity; if he apply for spiritual things,
and apply in faith, God&rsquo;s ear is <i>ever</i> open to his
cry; he will hear those that call upon him; he giveth liberally;
and on those who ask abundantly, he will bestow abundantly, that
their joy may be full.</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>&ldquo;Nor is the invalid tied down to any particular
form of words or mode of service.&nbsp; Having only God and
himself to consider, he has no other concern than to make known
his wants, and give expression to his feelings in such terms as
are best adapted to lay open his heart to that God, who, he
knows, seeth in secret, and who requireth to be worshipped in
spirit and in truth.&nbsp; He may, therefore, consider himself at
full liberty to contemplate the mercy of a reconciled God, in all
the variety of its boundless dimensions; the privileges of
acceptance, justification, and adoption, the unsearchable riches
of Christ, and the immeasurable consolation of the Spirit, as a
property of which he is invited freely to partake: he may come
boldly to the throne of grace, he may obtain mercy and grace to
help him in every time of need, and look up continually with
unfeigned hope and increasing confidence to that God who, over
and above the future inheritance of the saints in light, will
<i>here</i> supply all our need, according to his riches in
glory, by Christ Jesus.&rdquo; <a name="citation42"></a><a
href="#footnote42" class="citation">[42]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>In
contemplating a man of this character, of piety so scriptural,
and of talents, which, for variety and power, are rarely to be
found; we might perhaps have expected, that he would long be
spared to assist in carrying on that work of mercy, which,
through the divine goodness, had already prospered so wonderfully
in his hands; but,&mdash;God&rsquo;s thoughts are not our
thoughts, nor His ways our ways:&mdash;he has been taken away in
the midst of his usefulness.&nbsp; We might have expected, that
in his last hours he would have been permitted to testify of that
Saviour whom he served, and of the power of that gospel which he
had laboured to spread throughout the world.&nbsp; But, such was
the mysterious appointment of Providence, his vigorous mind
seemed to sink under the weight of the disorder which was fatal
to the body.&nbsp; Would it not have been better, we are ready to
ask, that he should be called away by a sudden death?&nbsp; No;
for to God it seemed otherwise: and, although he was for several
weeks previous to his dissolution able to say little, and
although it was difficult, towards the close of life, to excite
in him any sensible <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>apprehension; yet since, if ever he was roused to any
portion of his former energy, it was when the chord of religion
was touched; since there was something within which answered to
that sound, when all besides was silent, the testimony thus given
was neither unsatisfactory nor unimportant.&nbsp; How strong in
his mind must have been the influence of that heavenly principle,
which, amidst the wreck of his mental, as well as bodily powers,
could still survive, and still give proof of its existence!</p>
<p>And shall we be sorry, as men, without hope, for them that
sleep in Jesus?&nbsp; <i>I heard a voice from heaven</i>,
<i>saying unto me</i>, <i>Write</i>, <i>Blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord from henceforth</i>;&mdash;<i>Yea</i>,
<i>saith the Spirit</i>, <i>that they may rest from their
labours</i>, <i>and their works do follow them</i>.&nbsp; It
becomes us to be thankful, in the behalf of our brother, that he
now rests from all his anxieties; that the cares, and conflicts,
and vexations of life, can disturb him no more.&nbsp; Some of
these trials were deeply painful; but if we could ask what now
are his thoughts of them, and what are his present sentiments of
the course which he pursued, would he tell us, think you, that he
repents of his devotedness to the cause of piety and truth?&nbsp;
That, if his days could be recalled, he would be less active, <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>less zealous,
less persevering?&nbsp; Does he wish that he had listened more to
the voice of man, and less to that of conscience?&nbsp; That
instead of consecrating his talents to the highest purposes, he
had employed them to secure worldly distinctions and worldly
emoluments?&nbsp; Did he, while yet struggling with the evils of
mortality, record, in the very midst of his trials, how sweet it
was to have toiled in this work?&nbsp; And does he repent of his
exertions, and his sacrifices, now that he rests from his
labours, and his works do follow him?&nbsp; If it were no subject
of regret to him in <i>this</i> world, is it such in the world to
which he is gone?&nbsp; Oh, if we could at present perceive, as
we shall know hereafter, the vanity and emptiness of all earthly
things, when contrasted with those which are spiritual and
eternal; how earnestly should we seek first the kingdom of God
and his righteousness!&nbsp; And how trifling would all other
objects appear, when compared with that great object of promoting
the glory of God!</p>
<p>To him, whom we now bear in our affectionate recollection, we
are well persuaded that to die was gain.&nbsp; Ours is the loss:
and how deeply it is felt, this present assembly can
witness.&nbsp; But shall we mourn then for the great cause to
which his labours were devoted?&nbsp; And <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>especially
for that Institution, which is now deprived of his
services?&nbsp; Did the success of it depend upon human talent or
human energy, the loss might indeed be irreparable: but whatever
becomes of the agents of the Society, if it have the sanction of
God, it cannot fail to prosper.&nbsp; Whatever be the fate of the
Society itself, the work which it has so successfully laboured to
promote, will eventually triumph.&nbsp; The ways of God will, ere
long, be known throughout the earth, his <i>saving health among
all nations</i>.&nbsp; <i>For</i>, <i>from the rising of the
sun</i>, <i>even to the going down of the same</i>, <i>my name
shall be great among the Gentiles</i>: <i>and in every place
incense shall be offered unto my name</i>, <i>and a pure
offering</i>; <i>for my name shall be great among the
heathen</i>, <i>saith the Lord of Hosts</i>.&nbsp; Already, as we
may venture to hope, has an impulse been given, which shall not
be destroyed till it has reached the farthest nations of the
globe.&nbsp; Amidst all the conflicts and disappointments of the
world, Divine Providence is still steadily accomplishing its
plans of mercy and benevolence, and in due season they shall all
be fulfilled.&nbsp; In expressing our gratitude for having been
permitted to see the progressive advancement of the kingdom of
Christ in our own days, and to share in the privilege of making
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>known more
extensively the glad tidings of salvation, let us recognise our
duty and zealously discharge it.&nbsp; Let the death of those
that have toiled in this service, stimulate the industry of them
that survive: let every event of this kind be felt as a call to
increased energy and activity in all good works: that when this
world of strife and perturbations shall close upon us, we too may
<i>die in the Lord</i>: and, finally, with all his faithful
people, may have our perfect consummation and bliss, both in body
and soul, in his eternal and everlasting glory.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
